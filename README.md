Opticon Server Metering for OpenStack
=====================================

Opticon is the CloudVPS successor to its N2 monitoring service: A way of keeping
tabs on what your servers are doing for purposes of monitoring, performance
analysis and incident forensics. Opticon is designed to be used in conjunction
with the OpenStack Compute service, but can be operated independently.

Like its predecessor, the Opticon server agent uses *push notification* to send
updates to the central collector, allowing important performance data to keep
flowing even under adversial conditions, where traditional pollers tend to fail.

Components
----------

Opticon consists of three main program components. Monitored servers run
*opticon-agent*. On the other side, *opticon-collector* and *opticon-api* handle
the collection of data and interaction with users respectively.

The source code is organized into smaller modules, some of which are shared
between multiple programs:

**libopticon**

Data structures for keeping track of hosts and meters, as well as encoding and
decoding them for transport or storage.

**libopticondb**

Access to the timestamp-indexed opticon disk database that tracks metering
samples.

**libsvc**

Infrastructure for building a system service: Process control, data transport,
threading, and logging.

**libopticonf**

Code for handling configuration files and other JSON-like data.

**opticon-db**

Query and maintenance tool for the opticon database backend.

**opticon-agent**

Monitoring tool that runs on the client machines and sends the probe data.

**opticon-collector**

Receiving daemon that collects metering data and writes it to a database, while
also keeping track of alert-conditions.
